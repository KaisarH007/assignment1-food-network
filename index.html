            <h2 class="color-grey">About Me</h2>
            <p>My opinion is that cooking is the best hobby to have, because it can be very useful in life. Cooking is
                my hobby and has been for several years. I was about five years old, when I started learning how to
                cook. Cooking is something that I inherited from my grandmother; my grandmother was a professional chef
                and owned her own restaurant, where I learned how to cook. I have had other hobbies such as agate
                hunting but with agate hunting I found myself getting frustrated because I could not find any agate’s
                and it eventually became more of a head ach trying to find them than they were worth. But with cooking I
                can always find what I am looking for and it is not frustrating like trying to finding little pebbles in
                the sand.I know many people will disagree when I say cooking is a skill that is essential in reducing
                their stress levels but it works for me, but it also enables me to expand my cooking abilities and makes
                me a better cook, and a great cook is always trying to find new ways to make cooking fun and stimulating
                like me.

            <p>
                Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is rolled flat and cut, stretched or
                extruded, into long strips or strings. Noodles can be refrigerated for short-term storage or dried and
                stored for future use. Noodles are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with cooking oil or salt
